**1. Handcrafted Image Representations**
   - Implemented three different image representations for MNIST dataset:
     1. Raw Pixels
     2. Histogram of Gradients
     3. Local Binary Patterns
   
**2. Image Denoising with a Deep Image Prior**
   - Denoising images with
     1. AutoEncoder with Batch Normalization and Bilinear Upsampling
     2. Deeper Architectures, those with Skip Connections, as well as Averaging the Results across iterations.
